Despite Africa having the highest rate of female entrepreneurship globally, standing at 26% according to the [Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs](https://www.mastercard.com/news/eemea/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2021/january/africa-claims-top-three-spots-in-mastercard-index-for-highest-concentration-of-women-businesses-owners-in-the-world/), the technology sector faces a critical "broken rung" in the ladder to success: a massive funding gap. Recent data from [Africa: The Big Deal](https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/any-seats-for-women-on-that-rocket) reveals that out of billions in venture capital raised by African tech startups, **less than 2%** goes to female-led teams.

This financial disparity is a major driver of the pipeline problem. According to the [Accenture "Resetting Tech Culture" report](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/a-com-migration/pdf/pdf-134/accenture-a4-gwc-report-final1.pdf), the ratio of women in tech roles has surprisingly declined over the past 35 years, with women currently holding only roughly **14-16% of software engineering roles**. Initiatives like Mentor Match Kenya, She Code Africa, Tambua Women in Tech, Because She Can, Empower Her Community and Pwani Teknowgalz are fighting to reverse this trend by training thousands of girls, but they often struggle to secure the consistent resources needed to scale their impact.

Afara Dada Code is an AI-powered solution built to dismantle this barrier. Acting as an intelligent intermediary, this agent verifies and aggregates credible, certified female empowerment organizations across the continent. It provides donors—whether individuals, corporates, or DAOs—with a frictionless pathway to fund these initiatives directly. By using an agentic workflow, the system can answer questions about each organization's impact, process donations securely, and provide real-time updates on how the funds are being used.

The vision is to propel an Africa where women are equally represented across all career roles in technology. By solving the discovery and funding problem, we are not just building a donation tool; we are building a pipeline. We are ensuring that the 50% of the population that has been significantly underrepresented finally gets the "fuel" they need to drive innovation, closing the gender gap and enriching the African tech ecosystem.
