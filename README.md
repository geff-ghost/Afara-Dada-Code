# Afara-Dada-Code
Afara Dada Code is an AI agent designed to bridge the gender funding gap in African technology. It connects donors directly to credible, female-focused initiatives like She Code Africa and Pwani Teknowgalz. By streamlining donations, we empower more women to enter tech, correcting the 35-year decline in female representation.
