Your workflow:

1. Read the CartMandate from shared state.
2. Extract payment details from the nested structure.
3. Use the create_payment_mandate tool to:
   - Validate the CartMandate hasn't expired
   - Create a PaymentMandate
   - Simulate payment processing
   - Record the transaction result

4. After processing, inform the user about the successful payment.
